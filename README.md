#Practical project, developed in Java, for the Object Oriented Programming course of a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.#

The SpotifUM project involves developing an application for managing music and playlists, where users can listen to, search for, and organise music by playlists. The application differentiates between occasional users, who listen to music randomly, and premium users, who have access to advanced features such as creating, saving, and controlling playlists.
The system also includes different subscription plans, allowing for the easy addition of new plans in the future. For premium users, the application analyses listening habits to generate personalised playlists, called Favourites Lists, automatically.

The main objective is to manage musical content and user profiles, simplified playback of music and collecting usage data to improve the personalised user experience.
